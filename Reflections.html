<li>Unit 1</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>Describe/Summarize the concepts you have learned in the Html/CSS unit.<br>
        Throughout Unit 1, I have learned the basics of web design. In this unit, we used 2 languages: HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheets). We started out learning how to build the foundation for our websites (using HTML) and later, we learned how to style our websites (using CSS). For the final part of this unit, we created our very own electronic portfolio to showcase our work not only for the unit, but for the rest of the course. 
<br>
<br>
Describe any problems you faced while learning the concepts/topics described in 1.<br>
Before this unit/class started, I had limited knowledge of web design. I was not fluent in HTML or CSS, therefore it was quite difficult to keep up at the beginning. I also saw the web pages of the more experienced web designers and compared them to mine, dragging down my confidence in my work.
<br>
<br>
<br>
How did you overcome them?<br>
             W3Schools has been my best friend for this unit. I spent a lot of time learning the basics of HTML to keep up in the beginning. Even now, nearing the end of the unit I still refer to W3 for anything I do not understand or am confused about. I also utilized my friends in the class to help me get a grasp on the concepts of HTML and CSS. My friends are still always glad to help me whenever I need help.
<br>
<br>
What lessons have you learned for the future?<br>
      For the University program I am applying for (Bachelor of Information Technology), I need to hand in a portfolio showcasing my examples of creative work throughout my high school career. For my portfolio, I have decided to create a website (much like the electronic portfolio) to showcase these examples. The HTML/CSS unit has shown me how to create such a website that will in time, aid me in getting admitted into a post-secondary education program.
